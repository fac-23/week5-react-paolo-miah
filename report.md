# FacQuest Documentation üó∫Ô∏è

## Introduction 
A text-based adventure narrating your commute to space4.
We are building this for fun and to demonstate using the react framework.

## Project scope 
- [x] Accept some user input (e.g. a username)
- [x] Query an API (e.g. the Github API, or any other fun one)
- [x] Populate the UI with API data
- [x] Have some form of persistent state and interactivity, e.g.

## Project plan
* 2 day sprint including research, discovery, development.
* Used actual/estimate point to track and motivate the sprint.
* Assigned roles.
* Create issues with labels which were ordered chronoligically to struture the work.
* Create user stories:
- [x] As a player I want to be able to visually keep track of my progress
- [x] As a player I want to play the game and get a result
- [x] As a user I want to choose my username by accessing my GitHub

## Project learnings 
- Learnt how to create a simple interactive game with no prior experience!
- Understanding the basics of React.
- Keeping good work balance and communication in the team.
- Using ES lint.
- Deploying to netlify 
- Use of vite

Working effectively?
We worked effectively together as team and paired throughout but still had assigned roles.

What would you do differently next time?
Try to implement the following stetch goals:
- Rendered Avatars for the characters that are mentioned in the story.
- Add music and sound effects
- Make narration appear using 'typewrite' animation
- Make narration change depending on answers

## Project outcomes 
* Stayed within the timeframe for our goals and achieved 1 stretch goal.


Recommendations and conclusions 
* With more time implement stretch goals.
 
## Planning
Paolo: Facilitator/UX/QA
Miah: DevOps/UX/QA

## What interesting technical problems did you have to solve?
* applying the use.Effect method to our github API and ensuring the correct dependencies are passed into the array.

How did you debug issues that arose?
Apply structured techniques to problem solving to identify and resolve issues and debug basic flaws in code (S7)

Deployment
* We deployed early on netlify and this was automatically updated when we pushed to main.
